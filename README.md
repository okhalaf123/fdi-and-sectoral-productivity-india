## Project Overview

This project investigates how foreign direct investment (FDI) affects total factor productivity (TFP) in Indiaâ€™s manufacturing sector from 1990 to 2020. The study was motivated by the formation of Indiaâ€™s National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council (NMCC) in 2004, a policy aimed at attracting FDI and boosting industrial performance. Using macroeconomic indicators and sector-level productivity data, the project examines whether FDI inflows are linked to productivity improvements and how these effects vary across industries.

---

## Objective

- Assess whether post-2004 FDI-promotion policies improved TFP in manufacturing.
- Compare FDI-TFP relationships across 27 sectors.
- Benchmark manufacturing outcomes against a placebo sector (chemicals).
- Provide insights for industrial and investment policy design.

## Tools & Technology

- **Language:** R
- **Packages:** `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `car`, `readxl`, `zoo`
- **Structure:** Modular scripts for data prep, modeling, visualization, diagnostics.

## Methodology

- **Data Sources:**
  - Penn World Table (PWT 10.0): Capital, labor, and GDP
  - World Development Indicators: FDI and macro controls
  - India KLEMS: TFP growth by sector

- **Process:**
  1. Growth accounting to estimate TFP
  2. Regression dataset creation with macro controls
  3. Exploratory data analysis to identify patterns
  4. OLS regression modeling based on prior literature
  5. Sector-specific interpretation of FDI-TFP dynamics

## Key Visualizations

- **Growth Accounting Plot**: Showed that the share of productivity in output growth became more prominent after 2004, aligning with the formation of Indiaâ€™s National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council.
- **Moving Average TFP vs FDI Trends**: Revealed parallel trends between national FDI inflows and productivity growth in manufacturing-related sectors. Also confirmed flat TFP in low-FDI sectors like Chemicals.
- **FDI Distribution Plot**: Highlighted strong right-skew in FDI inflows, with multiple low-inflow years and fewer surges, affecting model sensitivity.
- **Average TFP by Sector**: Transport, Manufacturing, and Chemical Products had the highest average TFP growth. Several service and natural resource sectors had flat or negative averages.
- **Sector-FDI Correlation Plot**: Helped benchmark sectors by their observed correlation with national FDI. Some high-growth sectors showed weak correlation, underscoring importance of industry-specific policies.
- **Regression Variable Correlation Matrix**: Checked for multicollinearity between regressors to evaluate regression assumptions.

## Results Summary

- **Positive, Significant FDI-TFP Links:** Wood Products, Textiles  
- **Negative, Significant FDI-TFP Links:** Hotels & Restaurants, Construction, Electricity/Gas/Water, Chemicals  
- **No Significant Link in Manufacturing** despite moderate correlation and high average growth  
- **Placebo Sector (Chemicals):** High productivity growth not driven by FDI  
- **Multicollinearity:** Present among some macro controls (exports, imports, credit)

---

## Recommendations

- The **Ministry of Commerce and Industry** should enhance investment facilitation in upstream manufacturing segments like wood products and textiles, where FDI appears productivity-enhancing.
- The **Ministry of Power** and **Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs** should assess institutional or structural barriers that may cause negative productivity responses in construction and utility sectors receiving foreign investment.
- The **Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)** should develop clearer productivity-oriented FDI criteria in non-tradable service sectors, such as hotels and restaurants.
- The **Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers** should reassess its FDI policies and evaluate whether resource misallocation or rent-seeking might explain negative productivity impacts in the chemicals sector.
- The **Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation** should consider expanding public reporting of sector-level FDI to enable finer-grained research and policy targeting.

---

## Limitations

- National FDI data used as sector proxy due to lack of disaggregated data.
- Cannot isolate NMCC policy effects from other reforms.
- Linear regression models underperformed in certain sectors.
- Some controls showed multicollinearity.
