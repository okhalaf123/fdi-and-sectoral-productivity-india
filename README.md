## Project Overview

This project investigates how foreign direct investment (FDI) affects total factor productivity (TFP) in Indiaâ€™s manufacturing sector from 1990 to 2020. The study was motivated by the formation of Indiaâ€™s National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council (NMCC) in 2004, a policy aimed at attracting FDI and boosting industrial performance. Using macroeconomic indicators and sector-level productivity data, the project examines whether FDI inflows are linked to productivity improvements and how these effects vary across industries.

---

## Objective

- Assess whether post-2004 FDI-promotion policies improved TFP in manufacturing.
- Compare FDI-TFP relationships across 27 sectors.
- Benchmark manufacturing outcomes against a placebo sector (chemicals).
- Provide insights for industrial and investment policy design.

---

## Tools & Technology

- **Language:** R
- **Packages:** `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `car`, `readxl`, `zoo`
- **Structure:** Modular scripts for data prep, modeling, visualization, diagnostics.

---

## Methodology

- **Data Sources:**
  - Penn World Table (PWT 10.0): Capital, labor, and GDP
  - World Development Indicators: FDI and macro controls
  - India KLEMS: TFP growth by sector

- **Process:**
  1. Growth accounting to estimate TFP
  2. Regression dataset creation with macro controls
  3. Exploratory data analysis to identify patterns
  4. OLS regression modeling based on prior literature
  5. Sector-specific interpretation of FDI-TFP dynamics

---

## Key Visualizations

- Output growth decomposition by factor (Growth Accounting)
- TFP and FDI trends over time
- Distribution of FDI inflows (% GDP)
- Sector-wise average TFP growth and variability
- Sector-level correlation between FDI and TFP
- Regression coefficients and confidence intervals by sector

---

## Results Summary

- **Positive, Significant FDI-TFP Links:** Wood Products, Textiles  
- **Negative, Significant FDI-TFP Links:** Hotels & Restaurants, Construction, Electricity/Gas/Water, Chemicals  
- **No Significant Link in Manufacturing** despite moderate correlation and high average growth  
- **Placebo Sector (Chemicals):** High productivity growth not driven by FDI  
- **Multicollinearity:** Present among some macro controls (exports, imports, credit)

## Recommendations

See [full report](Full_Report.pdf) for tailored policy recommendations directed at:
- Ministry of Commerce & Industry
- Ministry of Finance
- Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers
- NITI Aayog

---

## Limitations

- National FDI data used as sector proxy due to lack of disaggregated data.
- Cannot isolate NMCC policy effects from other reforms.
- Linear regression models underperformed in certain sectors.
- Some controls showed multicollinearity.
